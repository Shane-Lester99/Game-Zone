## Description: 
This repository contains an app player which plays a select few of my
web based apps in most browsers. People can enjoy my applications and read
the source code to see how I built them. It also has pictures
and a description of the applications. If people want to contact me, the user also has
the option to reach me on LinkedIn or Github.

## Purpose:     
This application makes people without a software engineering background to be able
to access my applications. Many people dont know how to copy code on their local
machine and use it, and this application makes it as easy as possible to use my 
applications and check the source code to see how it was built. Lastly, it acts as
a portfolio for some of my work, so people can see what some of my current projects are.
