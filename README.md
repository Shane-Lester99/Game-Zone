## Description: 
This repository contains an app player which plays a select few of my
web based apps in most browsers. People can enjoy my applications and read
the source code to see how I built them. It also has pictures
and a description of the applications. If people want to contact me, the user also has
the option to reach me on LinkedIn or Github.

## Purpose:     
This application makes people without a software engineering background to be able
to access my applications. Many people dont know how to copy code on their local
machine and use it, and this application makes it as easy as possible to use my 
applications and check the source code to see how it was built. Lastly, it acts as
a portfolio for some of my work, so people can see what some of my current projects are.

## Contributions:

To create the app player, there were no contributions. However, some of the apps had contributions. So make sure to refer to the README if interested in who built what part. All of the apps were primarily built by me from scratch or near scratch, with minor contributions from others. Please read each projects individual README.md file and read under the section 'Contributions' for more information

## Browsers Supported:

	- Although it was tested on these browsers, it is playable across most browsers. In fact, if it doesnt work in some browser, please email me and let me know so I can fix it :)
